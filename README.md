# Lodestone Proxy

A small proxy to fetch data from Lodestone and put it in JSON format.

**Warning!** I have no plans to flesh this out into a full, hosted project. I'm simply doing this so that I can have character info on my [homepage](https://gethomepage.dev) via a local docker container. :)

## Running

This app can either be run using docker (preferred method) or by cloning and running `./main.py`.

## License
